Datasets:

a) Source Domain is going to be recipes of italian cuisine
That would create a keyword space 
(* once a basic model is built, dont use datasets, use realtime food recipe website through scraping)
b) Target Domain is going to be the titles of italian cuisine recipes on Youtube

The key to this project would be parsing real time database to update the keyword space

We need to prepare the data by using certain columns only

Realtime scraping:
We need a server that gets the website name and some changes in what class or div to be handled
to scrape the actual recipe of the food

Train_Data = recipe
Train_Labels = Appetizer/Entree/Dessert
