Datasets:

a) Source Domain is going to be recipes of italian cuisine
That would create a keyword space 
(* once a basic model is built, dont use datasets, use realtime food recipe website through scraping)
b) Target Domain is going to be the titles of italian cuisine recipes on Youtube

The key to this project would be parsing real time database to update the keyword space

We need to prepare the data by using certain columns only

Realtime scraping:
We need a server that gets the website name and some changes in what class or div to be handled
to scrape the actual recipe of the food

Train_Data = recipe
Train_Labels = Appetizer/Entree/Dessert, there is a total of 3 labels


Note:
If you want to increase your accuracy, you can use pre-made embeddings from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/


Final Idea:

I will have the source domain with 'recipe' and labels (apps,entree,dessert). We need labels because a video
about 'Appetizer' mostly recommends another 'Appetizer' not 'Dessert'.

Source Domain with labels and 'Recipe'.
We create 'topic-space' in a new column.

Target Domain with 'Title', 'Video Tags' and 'Labels'
Here, we will not be using labels for test_dataset.


We will do a cross domain transfer learning between the 'video tags' and 'labels' of target domain and 
'topic-space' and 'labels' of auxiliary datasets. We will also be using the test_dataset from target domain
while doing DANN.

This should train the model.

As a video recommender, it will take a food recipe or even just the title of the food, it will create a topic space
and then it will be next to the video-tag of the video of closest match as 'video.next'.
