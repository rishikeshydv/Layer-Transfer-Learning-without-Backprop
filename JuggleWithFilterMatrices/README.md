# Project Name: Activation-Based Filter Pruning for CNNs

## Description

This GitHub repository contains an alternative approach to training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by pruning filter matrices based on activation values in individual Convolutional and Dense layers. This novel technique eliminates the need for backpropagation via layer transfer learning, resulting in a remarkable 60% reduction in training time while maintaining comparable accuracy. The project is implemented using Python, primarily utilizing Jupyter Notebook for code development and experimentation. Key libraries and frameworks used include Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow, and Keras.

## Motivation

Traditional CNN training involves backpropagation to adjust the network's weights and improve accuracy over time. While effective, this process can be computationally expensive and time-consuming. This project seeks to explore an alternative approach by pruning filter matrices based on activation values, reducing the reliance on backpropagation and significantly speeding up the training process.

## Features

- **Activation-Based Pruning**: The core feature of this project is the activation-based filter pruning technique. Filters in Convolutional and Dense layers are pruned based on their activation values, which allows for a more efficient training process.

- **Training Time Reduction**: By eliminating the need for extensive backpropagation, this project achieves a substantial reduction in training time, making it ideal for large-scale CNN models.

- **Maintained Accuracy**: Despite the reduction in training time, the project ensures that accuracy remains comparable to traditional training methods.

- **Jupyter Notebook Development**: The project is developed and presented in Jupyter Notebooks, making it easy to follow and reproduce the experiments.
